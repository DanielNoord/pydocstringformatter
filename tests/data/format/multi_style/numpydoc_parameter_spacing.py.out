"""Euler's number.

Not related to Euler's constant (sometimes called the Euler-Mascheroni
constant.

Notes
-----
It is the limit of ``(1 + 1/n)**n`` as n approaches infinity, so it
is used in the equation for continuously-compouned interest.

It is also the sum of the reciprocals of the whole numbers starting
with zero, which is related to some calculus-related properties
mathemeticians find elegant.
